1-SAMPLE T-TEST

Formulating Hypotheses:
•  H0 : μ = 300
•  H1 : μ ≠ 300

The t-test checks whether the sample mean is significantly 
different from the population mean. 
Since the sample mean is very close to 300, the p-value will be higher,
indicating insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis 
at the 0.05 significance level.

1-SAMPLE T-TEST

Examine whether a new teaching method affects the average test scores of students. 
We hypothesize that the new teaching method has not changed the average test score
from the traditional method, which is known to be 75.

One-Sample t-Test for Average Test Scores
Formulating Hypotheses
•  Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean test score with the new teaching method is equal to 75.
H0 : μ <= 75
•  Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean test score with the new teaching method is different from 75.
H1 : μ > 75
