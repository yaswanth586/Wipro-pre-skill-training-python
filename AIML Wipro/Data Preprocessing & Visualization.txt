Data Preprocessing and Visualization

1.1 Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data
To identify missing data in a DataFrame==> isnull() and sum() to get a count of missing values in each column.

Techniques to Handle Missing Data
Handle missing data by either dropping the rows/columns with missing values or filling them with appropriate values.

Imputation Methods
Imputation involves replacing missing values with a calculated value, such as the mean, median, or mode of the column. 
Interpolation can also be used to estimate missing values.

=================================================================

Data Normalization and Scaling
Data normalization and scaling are crucial steps in data preprocessing, especially when working with machine learning algorithms. They ensure that each feature contributes equally to the result and improves the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

1.2.1 Why Normalization and Scaling Are Important
Equal Contribution: Different features may have different units or scales, which can cause some features to dominate over others.
Improved Convergence: Normalized data can lead to faster convergence in optimization algorithms used in machine learning.
Algorithm Performance: Some algorithms, such as those based on distance (e.g., KNN, SVM), are sensitive to the scale of the data.

1.2.2 Standardization (Z-score normalization)
Standardization scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done using the formula:

ùëß = (ùë•‚àíùúá) / ùúé
where 
Œº is the mean of the feature and œÉ is the standard deviation.

1.2.3 Min-Max Scaling
Min-max scaling scales the data to a fixed range, usually 0 to 1. This is done using the formula:

ùë•‚Ä≤=(ùë•‚àíùë•min)/(ùë•max‚àíùë•min)


1.2.4 Robust Scaling
Robust scaling uses the median and the interquartile range for scaling, making it robust to outliers. 

ùë•‚Ä≤=(ùë•‚àímedian)/IQR

Encoding Categorical Variables
When working with machine learning models, it is essential to encode categorical variables into numerical values since most algorithms can only handle numerical data. There are several techniques for encoding categorical variables.

1.3.1 One-Hot Encoding
One-hot encoding converts each category value into a new categorical column and assigns a binary value of 1 or 0 to each column. This method is useful when there is no ordinal relationship between categories.

Real-World Example: Customer Demographics

Consider a customer dataset where one of the columns is "Country". This column includes categorical data such as "USA", "Canada", and "Mexico". Using this data for a machine learning model, convert these country names into numerical values.

The dataset has the following entries for the "Country" column: USA, Canada, Mexico, USA, Mexico.
Using one-hot encoding, we create new binary columns for each country.

One-Hot Encoding Output:
USA: 1 if the customer is from the USA, otherwise 0.
Canada: 1 if the customer is from Canada, otherwise 0.
Mexico: 1 if the customer is from Mexico, otherwise 0.

Country_USA    | Country_Canada | Country_Mexico
     1   		   |       0     		   |       0
     0    		  |       1   			     |       0
     0    		  |       0   			     |       1
     1   		   |       0   			     |       0
     0   		   |       0    		    |       1

1.3.2 Label Encoding
Label encoding assigns each unique category a different integer. This method is useful when there is an ordinal relationship between categories, but it may introduce an unintended ordinal relationship if used inappropriately.

Real-World Example: Product Ratings

Consider an e-commerce platform where customers rate products on a scale of "Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", and "Excellent". These ratings are categorical but have an inherent order.

The dataset has the following entries for the "Rating" column: Poor, Good, Excellent, Fair, Good.
Using label encoding, convert these categories into numerical values that respect their order.

Label Encoding Output:
Poor: 0
Fair: 1
Good: 2
Very Good: 3
Excellent: 4

The transformed dataset would look like this:
Rating
  0
  2
  4
  1
  2

1.3.3 Ordinal Encoding
Ordinal encoding assigns each unique category an integer value based on a specific order. This method is useful when there is a clear ordering between categories.

Real-World Example: Employee Satisfaction Levels

Consider a company survey where employees rate their satisfaction levels as "Very Unsatisfied", "Unsatisfied", "Neutral", "Satisfied", and "Very Satisfied". These satisfaction levels are categorical with a clear order.

The dataset has the following entries for the "Satisfaction" column: Neutral, Satisfied, Very Unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, Very Satisfied.
Using ordinal encoding, we map these categories to numerical values that reflect their order.

Ordinal Encoding Output:
Very Unsatisfied: 0
Unsatisfied: 1
Neutral: 2
Satisfied: 3
Very Satisfied: 4

The transformed dataset would look like this:
Satisfaction
     2
     3
     0
     1
     4

===================================================================

1.4.1 Creating New Features

Imagine an e-commerce company wants to improve their delivery efficiency. They have the following data:

Order Date: 2023-01-01
Delivery Date: 2023-01-05
By creating the new feature Delivery Time, they find that the Delivery Time is 4 days. This feature can be used to analyze delivery times across different regions or periods and optimize their logistics.

Real-World Example: E-Commerce Sales Data
Consider an e-commerce platform with a dataset containing columns such as Order Date, Delivery Date, and Product Price. By creating new features, we can derive additional insights and improve model performance.

Scenario:
The dataset includes columns Order Date and Delivery Date.
We can create a new feature Delivery Time to represent the number of days between the order and delivery.

Feature Engineering:
Delivery Time = Delivery Date - Order Date

This new feature can help in analyzing the efficiency of the delivery process and its impact on customer satisfaction.

1.4.2 Polynomial Features
A real estate company wants to predict house prices more accurately. They have a dataset with features like:

Size (sq ft): 1500
Number of Bedrooms: 3
By generating polynomial features such as Size (sq ft)^2, Size (sq ft) * Number of Bedrooms, and Number of Bedrooms^2, they can build a model that captures the non-linear relationship between these features and the house price.

Real-World Example: Housing Price Prediction
Consider a dataset used to predict housing prices, where the features include Size (sq ft) and Number of Bedrooms.

We have the features Size (sq ft) and Number of Bedrooms.
By creating polynomial features, we can capture non-linear relationships between these features and the target variable (price).

Feature Engineering:
Polynomial features might include Size (sq ft)^2, Size (sq ft) * Number of Bedrooms, and Number of Bedrooms^2.
These polynomial features can help the model capture more complex relationships in the data.

1.4.3 Interaction Features

Real-World Example: Customer Demographics and Purchase Behavior
Consider a dataset containing customer demographic information such as Age and Income, along with their Purchase Amount.

We have the features Age and Income.
Interaction features can capture the combined effect of Age and Income on Purchase Amount.

Feature Engineering:
Create an interaction feature Age * Income.
This new feature can help in understanding how the combination of age and income influences the purchase behavior, which may not be evident from the individual features alone.

A retail company wants to understand how customer demographics affect purchase behavior. They have data on:

Age: 35
Income: $75,000
By creating an interaction feature Age * Income, they can better understand how the combination of a customer's age and income impacts their purchasing decisions. This can help in tailoring marketing strategies and improving customer segmentation.

Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance by creating new, informative features that capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.
